## Project

MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) — Elixir library implementing HTTP 402 payment middleware for AI agents and machine-to-machine commerce. Built on the [MPP spec](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs) co-developed by Stripe and Tempo Labs. Org: ZenHive.

Core idea: **payment is authentication.** No user accounts, no API keys. A client hits an endpoint, gets a 402 challenge with price + payment method, pays, and retries with an `Authorization: Payment` credential.

## Commands

```bash
mix test.json              # tests (AI-friendly JSON output)
mix test.json --failed     # re-run only failures
mix test path/to/file.exs  # single test file
mix test path/to/file.exs:42  # single test at line

mix dialyzer.json          # type checking (AI-friendly output)
mix credo --strict --format json  # static analysis
mix sobelow                # security scanner
mix doctor                 # docs/specs coverage

mix format                 # auto-format (Styler runs as plugin)
mix docs                   # generate ExDoc
```

## Architecture

This is a **library** (not a Phoenix app). It provides Plug middleware that any Phoenix or Plug app can mount.

### Protocol flow (what this lib implements)

1. Request hits a protected resource
2. Server responds `402 Payment Required` with `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` header containing a challenge (price, accepted payment methods)
3. Client fulfills payment off-band (Stripe charge, on-chain tx, etc.)
4. Client retries with `Authorization: Payment <credential>` header
5. Server verifies payment, returns resource with `Payment-Receipt` header

### Module map

```
MPP                        — Root module, convenience API, Discoverable entry point
MPP.Challenge              — Challenge struct, HMAC-SHA256 ID binding, create/verify
MPP.Credential             — Credential parsing, challenge echo validation, payload extraction
MPP.Receipt                — Receipt struct, base64url JSON serialization
MPP.Headers                — Parse/format WWW-Authenticate, Authorization, Payment-Receipt
MPP.Errors                 — RFC 9457 problem types (paymentauth.org/problems/*)
MPP.Intents.Charge         — Charge intent request schema (amount, currency, recipient, ...)
MPP.Method                 — Behaviour for pluggable payment methods (verify/2)
MPP.Methods.Stripe         — Stripe SPT → PaymentIntent verification (Req, no Stripe SDK)
MPP.Plug                   — The main Plug middleware (mount in any Phoenix/Plug router)
MPP.Plug.Config            — Validated endpoint config struct (pre-computed at init, includes method_config)
```

### Design decisions

- **Stateless HMAC-bound challenges.** Challenge ID = `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(secret, realm|method|intent|request|expires|digest|opaque))`. No challenge store needed — the server recomputes and does constant-time comparison on verification.
- **Intent = Schema, Method = Implementation.** `MPP.Intents.Charge` defines the shared request schema (amount, currency, recipient). `MPP.Method` implementations only handle verification. All methods share the same intent structs.
- **Explicit credentials.** Per `library-design.md`: no `Application.get_env`, no ENV fallback. Pass `secret_key`, `realm`, `method` module, and pricing explicitly via Plug opts.
- **Per-route pricing via Plug opts.** Each route mounts `MPP.Plug` with its own amount/currency. No global pricing config.
- **Base64url encoding preserves original bytes.** Critical for HMAC verification — never re-serialize, always use the raw base64url string from the original challenge.
- **Server-only method_config.** `MPP.Plug` accepts `:method_config` (a map) for secrets like `stripe_secret_key`. Public fields go to the client via `challenge_method_details/1`; private fields are merged into `charge.method_details` at verify time only, never serialized into challenges.

### Protocol constants

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Auth scheme | `Payment` |
| Challenge header | `WWW-Authenticate` |
| Credential header | `Authorization` |
| Receipt header | `Payment-Receipt` |
| Problem base URI | `https://paymentauth.org/problems/` |
| HMAC algorithm | HMAC-SHA256 |
| HMAC input separator | `\|` (pipe) |
| Encoding | base64url (no padding) |

### Dependencies

- `plug` — HTTP middleware framework (the integration surface)
- `jason` — JSON encoding/decoding for challenge/receipt payloads
- `req` — HTTP client for payment method API calls (Stripe, etc.)
- `descripex` — Self-describing API metadata (`api()` macro, `Discoverable`)

### First consumer

[api_cache](../api_cache/) is the first consumer — Phase 7, Tasks 47-51 in its roadmap. The Plug API must be mountable in a Phoenix router with per-route pricing. mpp has zero api_cache dependencies.

### Reference implementations (local clones)

Three reference repos are cloned into `refs/` (gitignored, auto-updated on session start via hook). **Read these directly — do NOT WebFetch from GitHub.**

```
refs/mpp-specs/   — IETF spec source (specs/, examples/)
refs/mppx/        — TypeScript SDK (primary reference). Key files in src/:
                    Challenge.ts, Credential.ts, Receipt.ts, Errors.ts,
                    Method.ts, PaymentRequest.ts
refs/mpp-rs/      — Rust SDK. Key files in src/: protocol/, client/, server/
```

Also available:
- IETF spec: https://paymentauth.org/
- Developer docs: https://mpp.dev/ (llms-full.txt for complete docs)
- MCP server configured in `.mcp.json`

### Conventions

- Styler is the formatter plugin (runs automatically via `mix format`)
- `test/support/` is compiled in test env (`elixirc_paths`)
- Spec source: `refs/mpp-specs/` (local) or [tempoxyz/mpp-specs](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs)
- Reference impl: `refs/mppx/` (local) or [wevm/mppx](https://github.com/wevm/mppx) (TypeScript)
- Reference impl: `refs/mpp-rs/` (local) or [tempoxyz/mpp-rs](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-rs) (Rust)
